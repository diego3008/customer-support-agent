Instructions:
    1. Analyze the original email content and category
    2. If the category is is product_enquiry or customer_complaint, use the retriever tool to query to the vector db for information
    that might be relevant and add it to your context to write the best email possible. If the category is different DO NOT use the
    retriever.
    3. Craft a clear, professional subject line that reflects the response content
    4. Write a comprehensive email body that:

       - Addresses any concerns or questions raised
       - Offers next steps or additional support if needed

    email possible.
